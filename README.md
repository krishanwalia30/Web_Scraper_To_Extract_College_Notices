This is a web scraper made using the prebuilt packages of nodejs, to extract the notices published on the College website for on-time alert and notification, in order to comply to the important instructions and notices being published by the university on their main website.

The motive behind this project is just for getting notified on time and avoid missing of important information or notices being published by the university in the interests of it' student.

## Packages Used

While making this project the packages that were used to scrape the College Website and then make it an API are:-
### Cheerio
Cheerio parses markup and provides an API for traversing/manipulating the resulting data structure. It does not interpret the result as a web browser does. Specifically, it does not produce a visual rendering, apply CSS, load external resources, or execute JavaScript which is common for a SPA (single page application). This makes Cheerio much, much faster than other solutions. If your use case requires any of this functionality, you should consider browser automation software like Puppeteer and Playwright or DOM emulation projects like JSDom.

### Axios
Axios is a promise-based HTTP library that lets developers make requests to either their own or a third-party server to fetch data. It offers different ways of making requests such as GET , POST , PUT/PATCH , and DELETE .

### Express Js
Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.
